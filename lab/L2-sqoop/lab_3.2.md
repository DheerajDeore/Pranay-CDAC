# LAB 3.2 -> Exporting HDFS Data to an RDBMS

***Objective -> Export data from HDFS into a MySQL table using Sqoop.***

***Pre-requisites -> Hadoop cluster on EMR should be up and running***

Following are the steps to be performed in this lab:-

1. Create a new hdfs directory using mkdir command with name salarydata

![dfs-mkdir](../../images/sqoop/export/dfs-mkdir.jpeg)

2. Put salarydata.txt into the salarydata directory in HDFS

![dfs-put](../../images/sqoop/export/dfs-put.jpeg)

3. Check whether the file is created on hdfs

![dfs-ls-txt](../../images/sqoop/export/dfs-ls-txt.jpeg)

4. Create a new Table in the Database as salaries2 using following sql command

*create table salaries2 (
gender varchar(1),
age int,
salary double,
zipcode int);*

5. Now export data from hdfs to database

![sqoop-export](../../images/sqoop/export/sqoop-export.jpeg)

6. Verify whether all records are been exported successfully

![verify-export](../../images/sqoop/export/verify-export.jpeg)



***Result -> You have now used Sqoop to export data from HDFS into a database table in MySQL.***
